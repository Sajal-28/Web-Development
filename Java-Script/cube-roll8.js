var n = Math.random();
// inside variable n random floating point number between 0 - 1.9999999999999999 is generated

n = n * 6;
// multiplies 6 with random number generated, its range is between 0-5

n = Math.floor(n) +1 ;
// it convert float into int value and by "+1" we can increase its range 0-6
